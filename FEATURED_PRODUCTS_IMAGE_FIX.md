# Featured Products Image Fix - Issue Resolution

## Problem
Featured product images (Ginger Beer, Jamaican Beef Patties, Organic Bananas, Fresh Avocados, Premium Cheese, Farm Fresh Eggs) were not displaying on the homepage.

## Root Cause
The `transformProductData` function in `productService.ts` had incomplete image path handling logic. When processing featured products from `featured-products.json`, the function was not properly constructing the full image paths.

## Solution Applied
Fixed the `transformProductData` function to:
1. Properly handle image paths for featured products by ensuring they get the `/images/products/` prefix
2. Added null/undefined check to prevent broken image paths
3. Added fallback to placeholder image if no image is provided

## Code Changes
**File:** `src/services/productService.ts`
**Lines:** 119-135

```typescript
const transformProductData = (productData: any): Product => {
  // Handle image path - ensure it starts with /images/ for proper serving
  let imagePath = productData.image;
  if (imagePath && !imagePath.startsWith('/images/')) {
    // If the image path doesn't start with /images/, prepend it
    if (imagePath.startsWith('products/') || imagePath.startsWith('sitephoto/')) {
      imagePath = `/images/${imagePath}`;
    } else {
      // For featured products, the image field is just the filename
      imagePath = `/images/products/${imagePath}`;
    }
  }
  
  // Ensure imagePath is not null or undefined
  if (!imagePath) {
    imagePath = '/images/product-placeholder.svg';
  }
  // ... rest of function
}
```

## Prevention Measures
1. Always test image display after making changes to product data transformation
2. Verify that image paths are correctly constructed for all product data sources
3. Include null/undefined checks for critical data fields
4. Test with actual product data, not just mock data

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - Featured product images are now displaying correctly on the homepage.
