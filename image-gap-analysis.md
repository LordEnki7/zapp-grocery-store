2. **Sauces & Condiments** - 10 products need these images  
3. **Dips & Spreads** - 7 products need these images
4. **Pickled/Preserved** - 6 products need these images

### Strategy
1. **Generic Product Images**: Create or source generic product category images
2. **Stock Photos**: Use royalty-free stock photos for common items
3. **Product Mockups**: Create simple product mockups for categories
4. **Prioritize Volume**: Focus on categories with most unmatched products
