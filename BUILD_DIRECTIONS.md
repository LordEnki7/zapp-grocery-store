## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing features for the ZAPP e-commerce platform, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Follow Modular Architecture:**
   - All implementations must follow our modular architecture as specified in [CODE_SAFETY_POLICY.md](CODE_SAFETY_POLICY.md)
   - Use the feature creation script for new features: `npm run create-feature feature-name`

2. **Maintain Documentation Alignment:**
   - Ensure all implementations align with the specifications in the build direction documents
   - Document any deviations or technical adjustments made during implementation

3. **Follow Development Process:**
   - Create backups at key implementation milestones using `npm run backup milestone-name`
   - Run architecture analysis regularly with `npm run analyze` 
   - Follow the contribution guidelines in the README.md

## Integration with Existing Code

The documents in the `docs/` directory should be considered the source of truth for business requirements. The technical implementation should follow these requirements while maintaining the established modular architecture.

Remember to:

1. Protect core modules as defined in our architecture
2. Use proper interfaces between modules
3. Follow the established UI design patterns
4. Implement proper error handling and loading states

For any questions or clarifications regarding the build directions, please consult the PDF documentation first, then discuss with the project lead.
